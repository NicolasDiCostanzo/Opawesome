## üìå About
[_Opawesome_](https://opawesome.org/) is a tool for creating **opossum-based memes**. Frustrated by the lack of easy ways to make opossum-style memes, I decided to build my own tool. It was crafted with love, passion, frustration, anger, and a subtle touch of nihilism.

You can help this project live beyond my room by contributing, making stuff with it, or sharing it with the world!

If you want to share memes, I'd recommend using [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.com/), as I'd like to build a community of opossum enthusiasts there. You can follow me on Pixelfed (I, sometimes, post memes (with opossums)): [@Majellan](https://pixelfed.social/Majellan)

### **Features**
- Make memes with opossums on them. Duh!
